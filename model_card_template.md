## Model Details

Framework: Scikit-learn

Purpose: Predict if a person's income exceeds $50,000 using census data.

Version: 1.0

Input Data: Includes a range of demographic and socio-economic characteristics.

Output: Binary classification indicating whether the income is '>50K' or '<=50K'.

## Intended Use

This model is created for educational purposes, allowing exploration of how different demographic factors impact salary predictions. It is aimed at data scientists, researchers, and students to help them learn about model training, evaluation, and deployment in machine learning processes. It should not be used for real-world decision-making without additional validation and testing.
